# RideSharer History

RideSharer History is an iOS app that presents a list of previous ride history, and allows the user to tap a row to present the price.

This iOS app was apart of a project I completed for [Lyft](https://www.lyft.com)'s [Mobile Engineering Virtual Experience Program](https://www.theforage.com/virtual-internships/prototype/z5WMH5vehnwDferzi/Lyft-Mobile-Engineering-Virtual-Experience-Program).
